# Private Placeholder
Hi! If you are seeing this, that means that you are using one of my private projects and went to the GitHub repository.

Most of these private projects are either a work in progress and/or some private stuff is in the code that I can't share.

Some of these projects can be found below where I will be updating the status of those projects and if I'm planning to make them public.


| Name           | Description    | Status     |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
|  EthanSecure   | Fast Discord Bot  | I'm probably not going to make this one public because I don't work on it anymore. |
| DroneBot  | A fast, open source Discord bot. | I'm going to make it public once it has a good amount of features  |
| EthanCore | A Minecraft mod that allows you to use other mods I make | I can't make this one public because it has some private code |
| PvPLiteCore (Java) | A fast, easy, and customizable Minecraft client. | Coming soon... |
| PvPLiteTools (Build, Core, etc.) | API wrappers and some build tools | Can't make public but they are modified forks of populaur API wrappers mostly. |

:D
